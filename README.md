## Toxicity_predicition:
It is a real life challenge.In class competiton where we were among top 3 teams.It use machine learning algorithms to create a model which predicts whether the given chemical is toxic or not. We used few machine learning algorithms such as Decison tree classifier, Random Forest, Bagging classfieir, XGB boost classifier got best accuracy of 85% with xgb boost classifier.

This is an exciting competition addressing a real-life challenge. use machine learning to create a model that predicts which chemicals are toxic.

With new chemicals being synthesized every day, toxicity prediction of newly synthesized chemicals is mandatory before they could be released in the market. For a long time, *in-vivo* methods have been used for toxicity prediction which involves studying bacteria, human cells, or animals. With thousands of new chemicals being synthesized every day, it is not feasible to detect toxicity with traditional laboratory animal testing. One great alternative for *in-vivo *methods is the *in-silico* techniques that have great potential to reduce time, cost, and animal testing involved in detecting toxicity. ToxCast dataset is one of the greatest data available in the field of toxicogenomics. ToxCast has data for approximately 9,000 chemicals with more than 1500 high-throughput assay endpoints that cover a range of high-level cell responses. In this challenge, you will have access to a prepared subset of data from ToxCast.


## Execution of code: 
We have used Kaggle platform for the toxicity prediction challenge. we also did our code execution and submission from Kaggle itself. 
We included all our source codes which is in (.ipynb format) and our output file (excel format). 
To Change the platform: 
To execute our source code provided in different platform rather than Kaggle we would prefer jupyter notebook. 

## Steps to execute code in jupyter notebook: 
1. Open-source code provided (.ipynb format) in the jupyter notebook. 
2. Upload the train, test and feamat csv in the jupyter notebook OR Change the train, test and feamat datasets address in the code by mentioning their current location in the system. 
3. Save and Run the code. 
 
Using Google Colab Notebook, we can convert it to .py extension and use the file for execution.
